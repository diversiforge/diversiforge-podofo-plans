# diversiforge-podofo-plans
Exactly what it says on the tin: PoDoFo book imposition plans by Diversiforge.

Usage:
```
podofoimpose source.pdf destination.pdf name-of-plan-file.plan lua
```

## 16 page, 4 sheet booklet
This will turn a PDF of single pages into a PDF imposed to four pages to a sheet, four sheets to a signature/folio. I typically use this with a 5.5"x8.5" PDF, to print on 11"x8.5" paper, but any PDF that is half the size of your target sheet size should do.
